        <h2>Welcome to Empress of Wands!</h2>

        <div class="about">
          <p>
            My name is Amber and I am the heart and soul behind Empress of Wands, a haven for tarot,
            spirituality, and divination enthusiasts. My journey into the mystical world of tarot began
            over a 5 years ago, during a time when I was seeking deeper meaning and guidance in my life.
            The moment I held my first tarot deck, I knew I had discovered something truly magical.
          </p>

          <p>
            Empress of Wands was born out of my passion for helping others find clarity, empowerment,
            and inspiration through the ancient arts of tarot and divination. My mission is to create
            a space where seekers can explore their spiritual paths and uncover the wisdom that lies within.
          </p>

          <p>
            At Empress of Wands, you will find a carefully curated selection of tarot and oracle decks,
            spiritual tools, and divination services. Each item in our store is chosen with love and intention,
            ensuring that you receive only the highest quality and most authentic products.
          </p>

          <p>
            I believe in the power of tarot to illuminate the hidden corners of our lives and to guide us
            towards our highest potential. Through Empress of Wands, I hope to share this incredible journey
            with you, offering support, insight, and a touch of magic along the way.
          </p>
