        <h2>Welcome to Empress of Wands!</h2>

        <div class="about">
          <p>
            My name is Amber and I am the heart and soul behind Empress of Wands, a haven for spiritual services,
            card readings, and divination enthusiasts. My journey into the mystical world of card reading began
            over 5 years ago, during a time when I was seeking deeper meaning and guidance in my life.
            The moment I held my first deck, I knew I had discovered something truly magical.
          </p>

          <p>
            Empress of Wands was born out of my passion for helping others find clarity, empowerment,
            and inspiration through intuitive guidance, spell work, and divination. My mission is to create
            a space where seekers can explore their spiritual paths and uncover the wisdom that lies within.
          </p>

          <p>
            At Empress of Wands, you will find a carefully curated selection of spiritual tools,
            candles, and custom services. Each item in our store is chosen with love and intention,
            ensuring that you receive only the highest quality and most authentic offerings.
          </p>

          <p>
            I believe in the power of card readings, ritual, and energy work to illuminate the hidden corners
            of our lives and to guide us towards our highest potential. Through Empress of Wands, I hope to share
            this incredible journey with you, offering support, insight, and a touch of magic along the way.
          </p>
